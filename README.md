# Instanews-App
The task is to create a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.
## technologies and features used:
- SASS and minified css stylesheets;
- Gulp for running JS tasks;
- ajax JS to filter up to 12 users stories from different categories, only if they have a picture;
- jQuery library;
- css properties to enhance UX by creting movement on website: transform, transitions, animations, scale;

## challenges
* The project was done on Windows and due to some errors I had major difficulties with installing node packages. Git Bash was unsufficient, so all commands are now run from Ubuntu terminal;
* I wrote the JS function butI believe it can be refactored for better code udnerstanding, using built method: slice() and filter() (to be checked);
* https// issue makes fetching data impossible sometime - I need to account for that (to be checked)
